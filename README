OVERVIEW

This is my personal website. It was written (mostly) in perl, while
calling out to python's excellent markdown compiler. 

DEPENDENCIES

These packages are oriented around ubuntu:

nginx apt-get install build-essential libfile-slurp-perl
libdate-calc-perl libclone-perl perlmagick libdatetime-perl
python-markdown

These commands will need to be executed in order to set up the rest of the dependencies:

# Install the HTTP::Server::Brick module
sudo perl -MCPAN -e 'CPAN::install(HTTP::Server::Brick)'

# Install the mathjax extension for python-markdown
FILE=$(python -c 'import markdown; print markdown.__path__[0]')/extensions/mathjax.py
curl https://raw.github.com/mayoff/python-markdown-mathjax/master/mdx_mathjax.py | sudo tee $FILE


INSTALLATION

1) Install all of the required packages. Copy the 'andygoetz.org'
nginx site config file into /etc/nginx/sites-available.

2) Link the 'andygoetz.org' file to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/andygoetz.org
Available fields in templates:

3) If you want to use the git hook to automatically update the website
when you push to a local copy of the repo, copy the 'push-to-server'
script to $GITDIR/hooks/post-update
